# Entire Sem

`entire-sem` is an Entire CLI plugin for entity-level checkpoint context.

Entire already knows a checkpoint touched `auth.py`. This plugin answers the next question:
which functions, classes, types, or methods changed inside that file?

This plugin builds a binary named `entire-sem`, which is invoked through Entire as:

```sh
entire sem commit HEAD
entire sem checkpoint abc123def456
entire sem diff --base HEAD~1 --head HEAD
entire sem analyze --json
```

## Status

This plugin implements the semantic checkpoint context proposed in
[entireio/cli#589](https://github.com/entireio/cli/issues/589). It intentionally
does not vendor or copy Ataraxy Labs' `inspect` / `sem` projects.

The plugin uses a tree-sitter-backed parser for:

- Go
- Python
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Rust

The parser is isolated behind `internal/sem`, so the command surface can stay stable
while the semantic model gets richer.

## Install

Install the plugin binary with Go, then copy it into Entire's managed plugin
directory:

```sh
go install github.com/suhaanthayyil/entire-sem/cmd/entire-sem@latest
entire plugin install "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/entire-sem" --force
entire sem version
```

If `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` is already on your `PATH`, Entire can also discover
the binary directly after `go install`.

## Install From Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/suhaanthayyil/entire-sem.git
cd entire-sem
mise run build
entire plugin install ./entire-sem --force
```

After either install path, `entire sem ...` works anywhere the Entire CLI can
find the managed plugin.

## Commands

Compare one commit against its first parent:

```sh
entire sem commit HEAD
```

Compare two arbitrary refs:

```sh
entire sem diff --base main --head HEAD
```

Emit JSON:

```sh
entire sem diff --base main --head HEAD --json
```

Analyze the commit associated with an Entire checkpoint trailer:

```sh
entire sem checkpoint abc123def456
```

Run without installing through Entire:

```sh
ENTIRE_REPO_ROOT=/path/to/repo ./entire-sem diff --base HEAD~1 --head HEAD
```

## Example Output

```text
Semantic changes HEAD~1..HEAD

auth.py
  ~ function validate_token signature changed (14 dependents)
  + class TokenClaims added
  - function parse_token removed (0 dependents)
```

## Why This Exists

Issue [entireio/cli#589](https://github.com/entireio/cli/issues/589) proposes showing
checkpoint context at the entity level instead of stopping at "this file changed."
`entire-sem` is a plugin-shaped implementation of that idea:

- parse the before and after git trees with tree-sitter
- extract named entities like functions, classes, methods, structs, traits, and types
- compare signatures and normalized bodies
- build a heuristic dependent count from parsed references in the target tree
- report added, removed, renamed, signature-changed, and body-changed entities

The implementation does not copy or vendor Ataraxy Labs code. The parser dependency is
`github.com/smacker/go-tree-sitter`, which is MIT-licensed.

## Current Limits

- Dependent counts are heuristic, not compiler/type-checker accurate.
- Rename detection is heuristic.
- The plugin is invoked as `entire sem ...`; it does not require changes to the
  main Entire CLI repository.
